# Leveraging-Deep-Learning-Architecture-for-Accurate-and-Efficient-Bone-Cancer-Detection-
An Msc Data science proposed project on Leveraging Deep Learning Architecture for Accurate and Efficient Bone Cancer Detection in Medical Imaging.
A 3 phase experiment was carried out across 3 models. In the 3rd and last experiment, Alexnet with canny edge detection outperformed other models, no overfitting or underfitting was observed.
